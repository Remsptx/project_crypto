# User guide

## Set Up
To setup the servers, simply go into your terminal and type the following command : 
 - docker-compose up --build

## To use the website : 
Go to http://localhost:3000
Click on login or register.

After register, it is supposed to redirect to the login page, but it doesnt seem to work.

You can access the different pages diredtly from the URLS : 
 - http://localhost:3000/registerPage
 - http://localhost:3000/loginPage

If nothing seems to happen, you are logged in, else, a message error will appear.
You can easily test this by trying to login with a false password, or register with the same credentials.


## Thank you !
